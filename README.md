A Basic Calculator App built using JavaFX is a simple desktop application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations
such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The interface is created using JavaFX components like TextField for the display and Button controls for the digits and 
operators. These elements are arranged using layout managers such as GridPane to form a clean and user-friendly design.

The application works by capturing button clicks through event handlers, which then update the display or carry out
calculations based on the user's input. When the user enters numbers and selects an operator, the program stores
the values and performs the appropriate operation when the equals button is pressed. A clear button is also included
to reset the display and start a new calculation.

Overall, this project demonstrates the basics of GUI development in Java, including event-driven programming, layout design,
and interaction between UI components. It is an excellent beginner project for understanding how JavaFX can be used
to build functional desktop applications.
